# MLOps for Deep Learning as a Service

In this section, we will explore MLOps specifically for Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS), focusing on the unique challenges and requirements of deploying and managing deep learning models in production.

Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that provides access to deep learning algorithms and models, allowing data scientists and developers to build and train their own deep learning models without having to manage the underlying hardware and infrastructure.

With DLaaS, users can **rent computing power from a cloud provider to run deep learning models on large datasets, and then access the trained models from anywhere with an internet connection.** This can be a cost-effective and convenient way to use deep learning technology, particularly for smaller companies or individuals who may not have the resources to build and maintain their own infrastructure.

Some popular examples of DLaaS providers include the clouds providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) AI Platform, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (other players are now in the game like Alibaba, IBM, Oracle, Hugging Face, Replit, Scaleway ...). These services typically offer pre-built machine learning models, as well as tools for building and training custom models.

In summary, Deep Learning as a Service provides a convenient and accessible way for data scientists and developers to leverage the power of deep learning algorithms and models, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## What to expect from DLaaS platform

Let's dive into some examples of what do DLaaS platforms : 

- **Data Management**: As more companies move their data from on-premise storage to cloud storage systems, the need to properly organize these data arises. Since MLaaS platforms are essentially cloud providers, that is, they offer cloud storage, they provide ways to properly manage data for machine learning experiments, data pipelining, thus making it easier for data engineers to access and process the data. 
- **Access to ML Tools**: MLaaS providers offer tools such as predictive analytics and data visualization for businesses. They also make available APIs for sentiment analysis, face recognition, creditworthiness assessments, business intelligence, healthcare, etc. 
Data scientists donâ€™t need to worry about the actual computations of these operations because they are abstracted by MLaaS providers. Some MLaaS providers even give you a drag and drop interface for machine learning experimentation and model building (with its limitations, of course).
- **Ease of use**: MLaaS offers Data scientists the means to get started quickly with machine learning without having to endure the tedious software installation processes or provide their own servers as they would with most other cloud computing services. With MLaaS the providerâ€™s data centers handle the actual computation, so itâ€™s convenient at every turn for businesses.
- **Cost efficiency**: Building an ML workstation is expensive, at the time of writing this article, a single Nvidia GPU costs $699 while a Google cloud TPU v2 goes for $4.50. 
So in fact, when choosing the in-cloud TPU the data scientist would have already computed over 155 hours of experiments when reaching the initial cost of buying the Nvidia GPU. Also, chipset needs a significant amount of power to work so the electricity bill will rise ðŸ’¸ MLaaS can also be beneficial in the development phase because you only pay for hardware when it is actually used.

MLaaS platforms offer these solutions and many more. Letâ€™s have a brief overview of some platforms offering these MLaaS solutions and how they can be accessed, you can read more about it in this excellent article of [neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai/blog/machine-learning-as-a-service-what-it-is-when-to-use-it-and-what-are-the-best-tools-out-there) ðŸ¤“

## Model Versioning and Experiment Tracking ðŸ”¬

First things thirst : experimentation !
Deep learning models often involve numerous experiments with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training data. To manage this complexity, it's essential to track experiments and maintain versions of your models.

### Example: Using MLflow for model versioning and experiment tracking

Install MLflow:

```bash
pip install mlflow
```
Initialize an MLflow tracking server (replace <path_to_mlruns> with a directory path where you want to store your experiment metadata):
```bash
mlflow server \
    --backend-store-uri sqlite:///<path_to_mlruns>/mlflow.db \
    --default-artifact-root <path_to_mlruns> \
    --host 0.0.0.0
```
In your Python code, log your experiments and models with MLflow:
```python
import mlflow

# Set tracking URI to connect to the MLflow server
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://0.0.0.0:5000")

# Start a new experiment
mlflow.start_run(experiment_id=1)

# Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts
mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.001)
mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.95)
mlflow.log_artifact("model.h5")

# End the experiment
mlflow.end_run()
```

You can learn more about MLFlow by reading their tutorials : 


## Automated Model Retraining

As new data becomes available, it's crucial to retrain your deep learning models to maintain their performance. Automating this process can help ensure your models stay up-to-date.

### Example: Using Apache Airflow to automate model retraining

Install Apache Airflow:
```
pip install apache-airflow
```
Initialize the Airflow database and start the Airflow web server and scheduler:
```bash
airflow db init
airflow webserver --port 8080
airflow scheduler
```
Create a new DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in the Airflow dags directory:
```python title="retrain_model_dag.py"
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator

def retrain_model():
    # Add your model retraining code here

dag = DAG(
    "retrain_model",
    default_args={
        "owner": "airflow",
        "retries": 0,
        "retry_delay": timedelta(minutes=5),
    },
    description="Retrain deep learning model",
    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
)

retrain_model_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id="retrain_model",
    python_callable=retrain_model,
    dag=dag,
)
```
Replace the `retrain_model` function with your model retraining code.

## Scaling Model Deployments

Deep learning models can be computationally intensive, and it's essential to scale your deployments to handle varying loads and maintain low latency.

Example: Deploying a TensorFlow model using Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving

Install Kubernetes and set up a cluster.
Install TensorFlow Serving.
Create a serving.yaml file for your Kubernetes deployment:


## Leverage the power of the cloud 

### Example: Using Replicate for 'on the fly' deployment

Let's try to build a model from scratch and deploy it on (https://replicate.com)[https://replicate.com]

In this mini tutorial, we will walk you through the process of running a simple deep learning model based on the MNIST dataset using Replicate. Replicate is a version control system for machine learning that tracks and stores model weights, training data, and other related files. This comprehensive guide will cover the necessary steps, from setting up your environment to training and evaluating your model.

#### Prerequisites:
To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A working installation of Replicate
- TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
- The MNIST dataset
- Install Replicate:

First, ensure that you have Replicate installed on your system. You can install it via pip:
```
pip install replicate
```
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:
```bash
mkdir mnist_replicate
cd mnist_replicate
```
Download the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow's built-in utility:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```
Normalize the pixel values and convert the labels to one-hot encoded vectors:
```python

x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)
```
Create a very simple deep learning model using TensorFlow:
```python
def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    return model

model = create_model()
```
Train the model using the preprocessed data:
```python
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)
```
After training the model, save it for later use:
```python
model.save('mnist_model.h5')
```
Initialize Replicate in your project directory:
```
replicate init
```
This creates a .replicate directory and a replicate.yaml configuration file.

Now you can edit the `replicate.yaml` file and add the following lines:
```yaml
repository: /path/to/your/replicate/storage
experiments:
- name: mnist-model
  path: .
  pythonpath: .
  script: train.py
```
Replace /path/to/your/replicate/storage with the path where you want to store your Replicate data.

Create a checkpoint after training the model:
```python
import replicate

experiment = replicate.init(path=".", params={"epochs": 10})
checkpoint = experiment.checkpoint(path="mnist_model.h5", metrics={"accuracy": history.history["accuracy"][-1]})
```

Load the model from the checkpoint and evaluate it on the test data:
```python
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model(checkpoint.path)
test_loss, test_accuracy = loaded_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print("Test accuracy: {:.2f}".format(test_accuracy))
```

If you want to compare different experiments, you can run the same model with different hyperparameters or architecture changes. Update the training script (e.g., train.py) with new hyperparameters or changes and re-run the script.
To compare different experiments, use the Replicate Python API or the command-line interface:
```python
import replicate

experiments = replicate.list_experiments()
for exp in experiments:
    print("Experiment ID:", exp.id)
    print("Parameters:", exp.params)
    print("Best Checkpoint Accuracy:", max([ckpt.metrics["accuracy"] for ckpt in exp.checkpoints]))
```
Or, using the command-line interface:
```bash
replicate ls
```

Replicate automatically tracks changes in your code, hyperparameters, and data. You can view the differences between experiments and see which code changes led to improvements in your model's performance.
To view the differences between two experiments, use the Replicate Python API or the command-line interface:

```python
import replicate

exp1 = replicate.get_experiment("experiment_id_1")
exp2 = replicate.get_experiment("experiment_id_2")
print(replicate.compare_experiments(exp1, exp2))
```
Or, using the command-line interface:
```
replicate diff experiment_id_1 experiment_id_2
```

Replicate makes it easy to collaborate with your team. Share the repository path with your teammates, and they can clone the repository to start working on the project:
```bash
replicate clone /path/to/your/replicate/storage
```
Your teammates can now run the same experiments, compare results, and make improvements to the model.

In conclusion, we demonstrated how to run a simple deep learning model based on the MNIST dataset using Replicate. We covered the necessary steps, from setting up the environment to training and evaluating the model. We also showed how to use Replicate for version control and collaboration. By following this mini tutorial, you should now have a solid foundation for using Replicate in your deep learning projects. 

You can also deploy your model with docker, even get a GPU machine with a pay as you go option, you can check all this in their well documented doc : [https://replicate.com/docs](https://replicate.com/docs)


### Example : Weights and Biases for precise experimentation 

Weights and Biases is a cuting edge tool for visualizing and tracking the performance of machine learning models, it's used by OpenAI to train gpt3 by the way ðŸ¤“. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for logging and monitoring key metrics during model training and evaluation.

Here's a mini tutorial on how to experiment with wandb using Python.

First, you need to install the wandb library and create a wandb account:

```bash
pip install wandb
```

Then, you need to initialize wandb in your Python script:
```python
import wandb

wandb.init(project='my-project')
```

Once you've initialized wandb, you can start logging metrics and visualizations during your model training loop. Here's an example of how to log the loss and accuracy during training:

```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Train the model
    loss, accuracy = train(model, train_data)
    
    # Log the loss and accuracy to wandb
    wandb.log({'train_loss': loss, 'train_accuracy': accuracy})
```

You can also log visualizations, such as images or plots, during training:
```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Train the model
    loss, accuracy = train(model, train_data)
    
    # Log the loss and accuracy to wandb
    wandb.log({'train_loss': loss, 'train_accuracy': accuracy})
    
    # Log a sample image to wandb
    image = next(iter(test_data))[0][0]
    wandb.log({'sample_image': wandb.Image(image)})
```

Once you've logged metrics and visualizations to wandb during training, you can view and analyze the results in the wandb dashboard. The wandb dashboard provides a rich set of tools for visualizing and comparing the performance of different models and experiments.

To view your experiments in the wandb dashboard, simply log in to your wandb account and navigate to the project page. You can then view the logged metrics and visualizations for each experiment, as well as compare the results across different experiments.

Here's an example of how to compare the results of two experiments using wandb:

```python
# Initialize wandb for two experiments
wandb.init(project='my-project', name='experiment-1')
train_model(model1, train_data)
wandb.finish()

wandb.init(project='my-project', name='experiment-2')
train_model(model2, train_data)
wandb.finish()

# Compare the results in the wandb dashboard
wandb.agent("my-project", function=compare_experiments, count=2)
```
This example demonstrates how to compare the performance of two different models in the wandb dashboard using the `wandb.agent` function.

In summary, wandb is a powerful and flexible open source tool for visualizing and tracking the performance of machine learning models. By logging metrics and visualizations to wandb during training, you can easily monitor and compare the performance of different models and experiments in the wandb dashboard.

## Model Governance/compliance, performance monitoring and alerts

Ensuring your deep learning models comply with regulations and follow best practices is crucial for maintaining trust in your service. Model governance involves tracking, auditing, and controlling access to models and their related artifacts.

### Example: Using MLflow Model Registry for model governance

Register a model with MLflow Model Registry:
```python
import mlflow

# Set tracking URI to connect to the MLflow server
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://0.0.0.0:5000")

# Register a model
model_uri = "runs:/<run_id>/model"
model_name = "my_model"
mlflow.register_model(model_uri, model_name)
```
You can also use MLflow's REST API to manage collaborators and their permissions. Refer to the MLflow REST API documentation for details [https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html)

### Monitoring 

Monitoring the performance of your deep learning models is crucial for detecting issues and ensuring optimal performance. Setting up alerts can help you respond promptly to any issues that may arise.

As we have seen in the introduction section we can configure alerts using Prometheus and Grafana to send notifications to a communication platform like Slack. For that it is important to configure your model serving API to expose performance metrics in Prometheus format. This can be done using Python libraries like (prometheus_client)[https://github.com/prometheus/client_python] or by instrumenting your model serving API with the appropriate middleware.

Set up alert rules in Grafana to trigger notifications when specific conditions are met, such as when the error rate exceeds a certain threshold or when the latency is too high.

By implementing these MLOps practices for Deep Learning as a Service, you can effectively manage and monitor your deep learning models in production, ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and compliance.
