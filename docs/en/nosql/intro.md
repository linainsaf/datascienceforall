# What are NoSQL databases?

**NoSQL databases, also known as "non-relational" databases, are a class of databases that don't use the traditional relational data model**. Instead, they use various data models such as document-based, key-value, column-family, or graph-based to store and manage data.

The term NoSQL was coined **in the late 2000s to refer to databases that were not based on SQL**, the traditional relational database query language. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data that cannot be easily organized into tables with predefined columns and relationships.

## Key characteristics of NoSQL databases 

NoSQL databases are important in modern data-driven applications because they offer several advantages over traditional relational databases. For example:

- **Schema flexibility**: Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases offer schema flexibility, which means that they don't enforce a predefined schema for data storage. This allows for greater flexibility in data modeling and can simplify development processes, as it eliminates the need to define and maintain rigid schemas.
- **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means that they can handle large volumes of data by adding more servers to the cluster. This allows for better performance and can reduce infrastructure costs over time.
**High availability**: NoSQL databases are designed to offer high availability, which means that they are able to maintain a high level of uptime even in the event of hardware failures or network outages. This is achieved through techniques such as replication and sharding.
**Data model diversity**: NoSQL databases offer a variety of data models, such as document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph-based, which can be used to store different types of data. This allows developers to choose the most appropriate data model for their application, rather than being limited to a single relational data model.
- **Performance**: NoSQL databases can offer better performance than traditional relational databases, particularly when dealing with large data sets. This is because NoSQL databases are designed to optimize read and write operations for large-scale data processing.

NoSQL databases have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in the context of big data and real-time data processing. They are used by a wide range of organizations, from startups to large enterprises, for applications such as e-commerce, social media, and mobile apps.

## Examples of NoSQL databases

## Types of NoSQL databases

NoSQL databases are a type of non-relational databases that are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema to store data, which makes them highly flexible and scalable.

There are several types of NoSQL databases, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of the most common types of NoSQL databases, including document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph-based databases.

### Document-Based Databases

Document-based databases store data in a semi-structured format, such as JSON or XML. Each document in the database contains a set of key-value pairs that define its structure. Document-based databases are highly flexible and can easily accommodate changes to the data schema.

One of the most popular document-based databases is MongoDB. MongoDB is known for its scalability, flexibility, and high availability. It is often used for real-time analytics, content management, and social media.

### Key-Value Databases

Key-value databases store data as a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and corresponds to a value, which can be a string, number, or more complex data structure. Key-value databases are highly efficient for read and write operations, making them ideal for applications that require high performance and scalability.

One of the most popular key-value databases is Redis. Redis is known for its fast in-memory data storage and retrieval, and is often used for real-time data processing, caching, and message brokering.
