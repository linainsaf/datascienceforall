# Redis 

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that is used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports a wide range of data structures, including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. **Redis is known for its high performance and low latency, making it a popular choice for real-time applications**.

Redis is **also known for its rich set of features**, including transactions, Lua scripting, pub/sub messaging, and persistence options. Redis can be used as a standalone server, or it can be used in a cluster for high availability and scalability.

## Installing Redis using Docker

Docker is a popular containerization technology that allows you to run applications in isolated environments. Using Docker to install Redis is a convenient and easy way to get started with Redis.

To install Redis using Docker, follow these steps:

- Install Docker on your system if it's not.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to pull the Redis image from Docker Hub:
``` 
docker pull redis
```
- Once the Redis image is downloaded, you can start a Redis container using the following command:
```
docker run --name my-redis -d redis
```
This command starts a Redis container with the name `my-redis`.
- You can check if the Redis container is running by running the following command:
```
docker ps
```
This command should display a list of running containers, including the Redis container that you just started.
- To connect to the Redis container, you can use the redis-cli command. Run the following command to start a Redis CLI session:
```
docker exec -it my-redis redis-cli
```
This command starts an interactive session with the Redis container and launches the Redis CLI.

Congratulations! You have now installed Redis using Docker and are ready to start working with Redis ðŸ¥³

## Basic Redis Commands and Data Structures

Redis supports several data structures that can be used to store and manipulate data. These data structures include:

- **Strings**: Strings in Redis can store text, numbers, or binary data up to 512 MB in size. They are the simplest and most versatile data type in Redis.
- **Hashes**: Hashes in Redis are a collection of key-value pairs, similar to dictionaries in Python. They are particularly useful for storing objects with multiple fields.
- **Lists**: Lists in Redis are ordered collections of elements, implemented as linked lists. They provide fast access to elements at the head and tail of the list, making them suitable for use as queues, stacks, or circular buffers.
- **Sets**: Sets in Redis are unordered collections of unique elements. They support a wide range of set operations, such as union, intersection, and difference.
- **Sorted Sets**: Sorted sets in Redis are similar to sets but with a score associated with each element. The elements are sorted based on their scores, allowing for fast access to elements based on their rank.

We will explore more in the next chapter.

These examples cover the basic CRUD operations for each Redis data type. In practice, Redis provides many more commands and options for manipulating and querying these data structures. You can find a full list of Redis commands in the official documentation: https://redis.io/commands

## Connecting to Redis with Python

In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to connect Redis with Python using the redis-py library. We'll focus on adding keys to the Redis database and retrieving them using Python. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a clear understanding of how to interact with Redis using Python.

### Set up 

Before starting, ensure that Redis is installed on your system. To install Redis, follow the instructions for your operating system on the official Redis website: https://redis.io/download

Next, you need to install the redis-py library, which is the Python client for Redis. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install redis
```

Then create a Python file and import the redis module:

```python
import redis
```
Connect to your Redis server using the following code:
```python 
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
```
The redis.Redis constructor accepts the following parameters:

- `host`: The Redis server hostname (default: 'localhost')
- `port`: The Redis server port number (default: 6379)
- `db`: The Redis database number (default: 0)

### Adding Keys to Redis

Now that we have established a connection to Redis, let's add some keys. In this tutorial, we'll focus on adding keys as strings, but you can easily adapt this code to work with other Redis data types.

To set a key-value pair in Redis, use the set method:

```python
r.set('user:1:name', 'John Doe')
r.set('user:1:email', 'john.doe@example.com')
```

You can also set a key with an expiration time (in seconds) using the setex method:

```python
r.setex('session_key', 3600, 'session_data')
```

### Retrieving Keys from Redis

To retrieve the value associated with a key, use the get method:

```python
user_name = r.get('user:1:name')
user_email = r.get('user:1:email')
```
The get method returns the value as bytes. To convert it to a string, use the decode method:

```python
user_name = user_name.decode('utf-8')
user_email = user_email.decode('utf-8')
```
If you want to retrieve multiple keys at once, use the mget method:

```python
keys = ['user:1:name', 'user:1:email']
values = r.mget(keys)
# Convert byte values to strings
values = [value.decode('utf-8') for value in values]
```

### Additional Operations with Redis-Py

The redis-py library supports various Redis operations, including:

- CRUD operations for all Redis data types (strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets)
- Transactions
- Pub/Sub messaging
- Connection pooling
- Refer to the redis-py documentation for more information on these features and usage examples: https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/

### Understanding Connection Pooling

Connection pooling is a technique used to optimize the performance of database connections. It involves maintaining a pool of open connections that can be reused by different parts of your application. This helps to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying connections frequently, which can improve the overall performance and responsiveness of your application.

The redis-py library provides built-in support for connection pooling. To use connection pooling, you need to create a ConnectionPool object and pass it to the Redis class when creating a new Redis client instance.

First, import the necessary modules:
```python
import redis
from redis import ConnectionPool
```

Create a connection pool and pass it to the Redis client:
```python
pool = ConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
r = redis.Redis(connection_pool=pool)
```

Now, you can use the Redis client `r` to interact with Redis as usual, and it will automatically use the connection pool to manage connections.

Let's look at some examples of how connection pools can be used in different scenarios:

#### Sharing a connection pool across multiple Redis clients:

If you have multiple Redis clients in your application, you can share a single connection pool among them to optimize connection usage.
```py
pool = ConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

r1 = redis.Redis(connection_pool=pool)
r2 = redis.Redis(connection_pool=pool)
```
#### Using a connection pool with multiple threads:

Connection pools are thread-safe, so you can use them in multi-threaded applications without any issues.

```python
import threading

pool = ConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

def worker():
    r = redis.Redis(connection_pool=pool)
    # Perform Redis operations with 'r'

threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(5)]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```

#### ConnectionPool configuration
The ConnectionPool class provides several configuration options to control the behavior of the connection pool. Some of the most useful options include:

- max_connections: The maximum number of connections that can be created in the pool. If this limit is reached, the connection pool will block until a connection becomes available. Default is None (no limit).
- timeout: The number of seconds to wait for a connection to become available before raising an exception. Default is None (wait indefinitely).
- retry_on_timeout: If set to True, the connection pool will attempt to retry when a timeout occurs. Default is False.
- socket_connect_timeout: The maximum time in seconds to wait for a connection to the Redis server to be established. Default is None (wait indefinitely).
- socket_keepalive: Enable or disable TCP keepalive. Default is False.
- socket_keepalive_options: A dictionary of TCP keepalive options. For more details on the available options, consult your operating system's documentation.

Here's an example of how to create a connection pool with custom configuration options:
```py
pool = ConnectionPool(
    host='localhost',
    port=6379,
    db=0,
    max_connections=10,
    timeout=5,
    socket_connect_timeout=3,
    socket_keepalive=True
)
r = redis.Redis(connection_pool=pool)
```
