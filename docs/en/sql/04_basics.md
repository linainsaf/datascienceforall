# SQL Basics understunding 

## Formal introduction 

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is a standard language used by most databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. SQL is an essential skill for any developer working with databases.

## SQL commands

SQL commands are used to interact with a database, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and selecting data.

<br />

The basic SQL commands include **SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE**, and **CREATE**. The **SELECT** command is used to retrieve data from a database, while the **INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE** commands are used to modify data in a database. The **CREATE** command is used to create tables and other database objects.

<br />

SQL commands are typically entered into a command line interface or a graphical user interface, such as MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin. These interfaces allow developers to visually design and manipulate databases, as well as enter SQL commands to manage data.

<br />

SQL is widely used in web development, data analysis, and many other fields. It allows developers to easily store and retrieve data, as well as perform complex data manipulations and analysis. Understanding SQL and its commands is essential for developers working with relational databases, and is a valuable skill in today's tech industry.

<br />

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the world of SQL and explore each of the major SQL commands in more detail. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of SQL, its uses, and how to use it to manage and manipulate data. With this knowledge, you will be equipped to tackle a variety of database-related challenges and create powerful data-driven applications.
