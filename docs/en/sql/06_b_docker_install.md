# Install MySQL server with docker 

Before we get started, it's important to note that Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to run software applications in isolated environments called containers. This means that you can interact with MySQL server without installing it from scrach and run multiple instances of the same application without any interference between them.

Now let's dive into the tutorial:

## Step 1: Install Docker
If you don't have Docker installed on your system, you'll need to download and install it first. You can download Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

## Step 2: Pull the MySQL Docker image

In Docker, images are used to create containers, which are isolated environments that run applications. Images can be thought of as a template for containers, as they contain all the necessary files, libraries, and dependencies required for an application to run.

The `docker pull` command is used to download an image from a remote registry, such as Docker Hub. When you run this command, Docker will search for the specified image in the remote registry and download it to your local machine.

Once Docker is installed, open a terminal and run the following command to pull the MySQL Docker image:
```bash 
docker pull mysql
```
This command will download the MySQL image to your local machine, which you can then use to create a container.

It's important to note that you must have Docker installed on your local machine to use the `docker pull` command, as it is a Docker CLI command. Additionally, the image you're trying to pull must be available in the remote registry you're trying to access.

## Step 3: Start a MySQL container
After you have pulled the MySQL Docker image, you can start a container using the following command:
```bash
docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mysql
```
This command will start a new container named "mysql-container" with the root password `my-secret-pw`

## Step 4: Access the MySQL container with the command line 
To access the MySQL container, you can use the following command:
```bash
docker exec -it mysql-container mysql -p
```
This command will start a MySQL shell session inside the container and prompt you to enter the password you set in the previous step.

## Step 5: Create a test database and a table

Now that you have access to the MySQL container, you can create a database and a table using the following commands:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
USE testdb;
CREATE TABLE users (
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

These commands will create a new database named "testdb" and a new table named "users" with three columns: "id", "name", and "email".

## Step 6: Insert values into the table

You can insert values into the table using the following command:
```sql 
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');
```
This command will insert a new row into the "users" table with the name "John Doe" and the email "johndoe@example.com".

## Step 7: Test a query
Finally, you can test a query to retrieve the data you just inserted using the following command:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This command will retrieve all the data from the "users" table.

And that's it! You've successfully installed MySQL with Docker and created a table, inserted values, and executed a test query ðŸ¥³
