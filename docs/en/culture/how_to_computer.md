# ðŸš§ What is a computer --> TO DO ðŸš§

Sure, I can try to explain it to you like you're 12 years old.

A computer is like a big brain that helps us do lots of things. It's made up of lots of different parts that work together. The most important parts are the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the memory, and the input/output devices like the keyboard, mouse, and screen.

The CPU is like the boss of the computer. It tells all the other parts what to do and how to do it. The memory is like the computer's short-term memory. It's where the computer stores information that it needs to use right away. The input/output devices are like the computer's senses. They help us give commands to the computer and see what it's doing.

Now, let's talk about how electricity is transformed into a signal. Inside the computer, there are tiny parts called transistors that can turn electricity on and off very quickly. These on and off signals are called binary code and they're what the computer uses to communicate.

Finally, let's talk about how languages work on a computer. A language is just a set of instructions that the computer can understand. These instructions are written in a special code called a programming language. When we write a program, we use this language to tell the computer what to do. The computer then uses its CPU, memory, and other parts to follow these instructions and do what we want it to do.

can you detail me this subject into a detailed tutorial ? 

Certainly, let's dive into the details!

How a Computer Works:

A computer is a complex machine made up of many different components, including hardware and software. Understanding how these components work together is key to understanding how a computer works.

Hardware Components:
The hardware components of a computer are the physical parts that make up the machine. Some of the most important hardware components include:
Central Processing Unit (CPU): This is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for performing calculations and executing instructions.
Memory (RAM): This is the computer's temporary storage, where it stores information that it needs to access quickly.
Storage: This is where the computer stores all of its data and programs. It can be either hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).
Input/output devices: These devices allow us to communicate with the computer, including the keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, and speakers.
Software Components:
The software components of a computer are the programs and applications that run on the machine. Some of the most important software components include:
Operating System (OS): This is the software that manages all of the computer's resources, including the hardware and software components.
Applications: These are the programs that we use on the computer, such as Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, or Photoshop.
Drivers: These are the software that allows the computer to communicate with specific hardware devices, such as printers or scanners.
How Electricity is Transformed into a Signal:
Inside the computer, electricity is used to power the various hardware components. However, in order to communicate with these components, the electricity must be transformed into a signal.
Binary Code: Computers use a language called binary code, which is made up of only two digits: 0 and 1. These digits represent the on and off states of electrical switches, called transistors.
Transistors: Transistors are tiny electronic devices that can switch on and off very quickly, allowing them to create the binary code that the computer uses to communicate.
Circuits: The transistors are connected together in circuits, which are then used to perform calculations and execute instructions.
How Languages Work on a Computer:
Programming languages allow us to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute. There are many different programming languages, but they all have some common elements:
Syntax: Programming languages have their own syntax, which is a set of rules for writing code. Syntax errors occur when the code is not written correctly.
Variables: Variables are used to store data in a program. They can be used to hold numbers, text, or other types of information.
Statements: Statements are individual commands in a program. They can be used to perform calculations, manipulate data, or control the flow of the program.
Functions: Functions are groups of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program. They can be used to perform complex calculations or operations.
In summary, a computer is a complex machine that uses electricity to power its hardware components, which are controlled by software programs. The electricity is transformed into a signal using binary code, which allows the computer to communicate with its various components. Programming languages allow us to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute.
