# Welcome to The Data Science Class

## Introduction

In this class, we will explore the fundamental concepts and techniques used in the field of data science, including statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and more. You will learn how to extract insights and make predictions from large and complex datasets using a variety of tools and techniques. Whether you are new to the field or have some experience, this class will provide you with the skills and knowledge you need to succeed as a data scientist. 

## What is Data Science

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves the use of various techniques and tools such as machine learning, statistical analysis, and visualization to extract useful information and insights from data. This information can then be used to make decisions, predictions, or to inform research.

## Planning of the course


* **Python Programming** : Python's simplicity, readability, and the availability of powerful libraries and modules make it a great choice for data science tasks, from data manipulation and analysis to building and deploying machine learning models.

* **Data Base Management System** : In data science, it is often necessary to work with large amounts of data that are stored in databases. Database management systems (DBMS) provide a way to organize, store, and retrieve data in an efficient and organized way.

* **R Programming** : R is particularly useful for data analysis in fields such as genomics, finance, and social sciences.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis** : Is an essential step in the data science process. It is the process of analyzing and summarizing the main characteristics of a data set, and is used to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. EDA helps data scientists to understand the data they are working with, identify any potential issues or biases, and select the appropriate statistical techniques to use for further analysis. It also helps to create a solid foundation for building models and making predictions. 

* **Machine Learning** :  It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task

* **Deep Learning** : Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain, specifically the neural networks. It involves training large artificial neural networks to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision making. These neural networks are trained using large amounts of data and are able to learn and improve over time. Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in many areas and has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. It is widely used in applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and self-driving cars.

* **AI models Deployement** : AI models deployments refer to the process of taking a trained AI model and making it available for use in a production environment. This can include things like scaling the model to handle large amounts of data, integrating the model with other systems and software, and monitoring the performance of the model in a live setting.

* **Data Visualization using Tableau/Power Bi** : Data visualization is the process of creating graphical representations of data in order to effectively communicate insights and findings. Tableau and Power BI are both popular tools used for data visualization. They offer a wide range of interactive visualizations, including maps, charts, and dashboards

* **Capstone Project** : The project is designed to apply the knowledge and skills that students have learned throughout the program. It is typically a hands-on, real-world project that requires students to use data science techniques and tools to solve a problem or answer a research question. The project can be based on any topic that is relevant to data science and can include tasks such as data collection, cleaning, exploration, analysis, modeling, and visualization.
