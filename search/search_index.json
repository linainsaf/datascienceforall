This enables code reuse, allowing new classes to be defined with little or no modifications to the existing classes.</p> <p>For example, consider a superclass called Animal which has attributes such as name, species, and age, and a method called make_sound() that returns the sound the animal makes.

We can change the color of a line using the color parameter of the plotting function. For example:</p> <p><pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n# Plot data\nplt.plot(x, y)\n# Add title and labels\nplt.title('Line Plot', color='red')\nplt.xlabel('X Axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y Axis')\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> This will plot the data using a red line. We can also use a variety of named colors such as blue, green, orange, purple, brown, and gray. We can also use color maps to map numerical values to colors. Matplotlib provides several built-in color maps, such as viridis, plasma, inferno, and magma. Here's an example:</p> <pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n# Get the weight of each point\nz = np.random.rand(5)\n# Plot using color map \nplt.scatter(x, y, c=z ,cmap='plasma')\nplt.colorbar()\n</code></pre> <p>This will plot a scatter plot where the color of each point is determined by the corresponding value of z. The cmap parameter specifies the name of the color map to use, and the colorbar() function adds a color bar to the plot.</p> <p></p> <p>Line Styles : We can also change the style of lines in a plot using the linestyle parameter of the plotting function. Matplotlib provides several built-in line styles, such as solid lines ('-'), dashed lines ('--'), dotted lines (':'), and dash-dot lines ('--'). Here's an example:</p> <pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n# Plot data\nplt.plot(x, y, linestyle='--')\n# Add title and labels\nplt.title('Line Plot', color='red')\nplt.xlabel('X Axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y Axis')\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n</code></pre> <p>This will plot the data using a dashed line.

In this example, we create one row and two columns of subplots. The figsize parameter specifies the size of the figure in inches.</p> <p></p> <p>The function returns two objects: the fig object that represents the whole figure and the axs object that represents the array of subplots. We can use indexing to access individual subplots. In this example, axs[0] represents the left subplot, and axs[1] represents the right subplot.</p> <p></p> <p>We can plot data on each subplot by calling plotting functions on the corresponding axs object.
