Database management systems (DBMS) provide a way to organize, store, and retrieve data in an efficient and organized way.</p> </li> <li> <p>R Programming : R is particularly useful for data analysis in fields such as genomics, finance, and social sciences.</p> </li> <li> <p>Exploratory Data Analysis : Is an essential step in the data science process. It is the process of analyzing and summarizing the main characteristics of a data set, and is used to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. EDA helps data scientists to understand the data they are working with, identify any potential issues or biases, and select the appropriate statistical techniques to use for further analysis. It also helps to create a solid foundation for building models and making predictions. </p> </li> <li> <p>Machine Learning :  It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task</p> </li> <li> <p>Deep Learning : Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the brain, specifically the neural networks. It involves training large artificial neural networks to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision making. These neural networks are trained using large amounts of data and are able to learn and improve over time. Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in many areas and has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. It is widely used in applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and self-driving cars.</p> </li> <li> <p>AI models Deployement : AI models deployments refer to the process of taking a trained AI model and making it available for use in a production environment.
